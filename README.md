# Festival Management Database

## Overview
This project implements a **PostgreSQL** database for managing the annual Pulse University music festival. It covers:

- Festivals, Events & Performances
- Venue locations 
- Stages & Technical equipment
- Staff assignment with roles
- Artists & bands, musical genres & sub-genres
- Tickets, resale queue & buyer queue  
- Performance ratings (Likert scale)  
- Image/media management

The system includes a wide range of **constraints**, **functions**, and **triggers** to ensure the correct operation of the database and maintain data integrity and consistency throughout all use cases.

Additionally, the database is populated with essential test data that enables the verification and demonstration of all major functionalities and constraints.
